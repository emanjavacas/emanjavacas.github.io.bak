I started this blog with a miscellaneous handfull of goals in mind. Probably, it should've been started by new year, but I got too late at this year's new year resolutions.

I intend the content in this blog to be mostly centered around my hormic, yet purposive and often unaccomplished trials of teaching myself geeky tech stuff.

This means that I do not necessarily expect the blog to be relevant for people other than me - but I'll be of course happy if it attracts the attention of others.
