title: The day I connected to a remote nREPL
tags: geekery emacs clojure
---

<p>
On one of my usual adventures to our beloved server I happened to need to make use of a Clojure Lein nREPL to play and interact with.
Of course, for productivity, this has to go through Emacs. I thought that it would be as easy as it normally is and that I
could do the standard
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-text">M-x cider-jack-in
</pre>
</div>

<p>
on a remote file and be happy. But it didn&rsquo;t work for reasons probably related to the way I installed <code>lein</code> on the server<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I got inspired by this <a href="http://asymmetrical-view.com/2009/08/20/emacs-slime-remote-repl.html">old post</a> from 2009 and tried an alternative way using a SSH-tunnel.
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s how it goes:
</p>


<p>
<b>First</b> Have a nREPL process running inside a <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/acuy">screen</a> on the remote server.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t have to run
through <code>screen</code>, but it sure has advantages, the most prominent being that the process won&rsquo;t die in case of a connection failure.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-text">$ screen -S repl
$ lein repl
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will output the usual welcome message:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-text">nREPL server started on port 55222 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:55222
REPL-y 0.3.5, nREPL 0.2.6

    Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
 Results: Stored in vars *1, *2, *3, an exception in *e

user=&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now take note of the port (in this case 55222), because we will use it as the destination port of the ssh tunnel.
</p>

<p>
<b>Second</b> Create a SSH tunnel (info <a href="http://www.revsys.com/writings/quicktips/ssh-tunnel.html">here</a>) between a local port of your choice (1008 for instance) and the local port in the server where the nREPL is running (55222 in this case).
</p>


<p>
This means:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-text">ssh -L 1009:localhost:55222 username@remotehost
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<b>Finally</b> you need to navigate to a clojure project in the remote host via <code>tramp</code> and then connect to the tunneled port.
Now, I was used to invoke my repls in <code>emacs</code> through <code>M-x cider-jack-in</code>. This time you will be using <code>M-x cider-connect</code> instead
and explicitly connect to the entry port that you specified when setting up the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
For this example, I wrote
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-text">M-x cider-connect RET localhost RET 1009
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and voil√°! a cider-repl buffer automatically showed up. Note that we don&rsquo;t have to wait for the JVM to start since it is already running at the other side of the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
And so I was able to happily enjoy interactive developing on a remote server. Hooray!
